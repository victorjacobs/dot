# Dot files

This repository contains my dot files for:

- fish
- vim
- git

## Installation

1. Install git and curl
    - On Mac, install vim from homebrew. That version is compiled with a feature flag 'mac', to detect when running on a Mac
2. Run following:
```bash
curl -Lks vjcbs.dev/dot.sh | bash
```
